# DoNutSentry v1 Implementation - 2025-08-16

## What was implemented

### 1. Recursive DNS resolver support (Issue #12)
- Added wildcard DNS handling for `*.q.ch.at`
- Enables queries through any DNS resolver, not just direct to ch.at
- Works behind corporate firewalls and restricted networks

### 2. Query encoding strategies
- **Simple encoding**: For basic queries (alphanumeric + spaces, <50 chars)
  - Example: `what-is-rust.q.ch.at`
- **Base32 encoding**: For complex queries with special characters
  - Uses hi-base32 library (RFC 4648 compliant)
  - Example: `nfxgc4tfoqwwc3tt.q.ch.at`

### 3. Session mode for large queries
- Automatic activation when query exceeds DNS limits (255 bytes)
- Anonymous RSA key exchange for session establishment
- Chunked transmission with sequence numbers
- Flow:
  1. Client sends public key: `<pubkey_hash>.init.q.ch.at`
  2. Server returns encrypted session ID
  3. Client sends chunks: `<session_id>.<chunk_num>.<data>.q.ch.at`
  4. Client executes: `<session_id>.<total_chunks>.exec.q.ch.at`
  5. Server returns full response (up to 4KB)

### 4. JavaScript/TypeScript client
- Full client implementation in `mega_feature_development/DoNutSentry/client-js/`
- Automatic encoding selection
- Transparent session mode for large queries
- Comprehensive test coverage

## What was NOT implemented

### Compression (removed)
- LZSS compression was attempted but removed
- Issue: Base32 encoding overhead (1.6x) negates compression benefits
- Example: 102 bytes → 88 bytes compressed → 165 chars base32 encoded (worse than 164 chars direct)
- Decision: Use session mode for large queries instead

## Key technical decisions

1. **Base32 encoding**: Standard RFC 4648 for DNS compatibility
2. **Session security**: 32-byte session IDs, RSA-encrypted during exchange
3. **Chunk sizing**: Calculated based on remaining DNS label space
4. **No compression**: Session mode handles large queries better

## Testing

- All tests pass with real crypto (no mocks)
- Session mode properly handles queries >255 bytes
- Encoding selection works correctly

## Next steps for server implementation

1. Implement wildcard DNS handler in `dns.go`
2. Add session storage (in-memory with TTL)
3. Handle RSA key exchange and session ID encryption
4. Implement chunk assembly and execution
5. Ensure backward compatibility with direct queries

## Usage

```javascript
import { DoNutSentryClient } from '@ch.at/donutsentry-client';

const client = new DoNutSentryClient();

// Automatically selects encoding and mode
const result = await client.query('Your query here...');
console.log(result.response);
```

The client handles everything transparently - short queries use simple/base32 encoding, long queries automatically use session mode with chunking.
