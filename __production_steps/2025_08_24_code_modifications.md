# ch.at Code Modifications Log
**Date**: August 24, 2025
**Branch**: chris/donutsentry
**Purpose**: Production deployment improvements for ch.at

## Modifications Made

### 1. Created config.go - Dynamic Port Configuration
**File**: `config.go` (new file)
**Changes**:
- Moved port configuration from hardcoded constants to runtime variables
- Added `HIGH_PORT_MODE` environment variable support:
  - When `HIGH_PORT_MODE=true`, uses non-privileged ports (8080, 8443, 2222, 8053)
  - Otherwise uses standard ports (80, 443, 22, 53)
- Added SSL certificate detection function `findSSLCertificates()`:
  - Checks working directory for cert.pem/key.pem
  - Falls back to Let's Encrypt standard paths
  - Checks common alternative locations
- Added logging for port configuration on startup

**Rationale**: Allows development without root privileges and better SSL cert handling

### 2. Updated chat.go - Main Entry Point
**File**: `chat.go`
**Changes**:
- Removed hardcoded port constants (moved to config.go)
- Added import for "log" package
- Updated HTTPS server startup to use `findSSLCertificates()`
- Added warning messages if SSL certificates not found
- HTTPS now gracefully disables if certificates missing

**Rationale**: Better error handling and certificate management

### 3. Added Health Check Endpoint
**File**: `http.go`
**Changes**:
- Added `/health` endpoint handler
- Added "os" to imports
- Health check returns JSON with:
  - Service status for each protocol
  - Port configuration
  - Development/production mode
  - LLM configuration status
  - SSL certificate availability
  - DoNutSentry domain configuration

**Example response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "http": true,
    "https": true,
    "ssh": true,
    "dns": true
  },
  "ports": {
    "http": 80,
    "https": 443,
    "ssh": 22,
    "dns": 53
  },
  "mode": "production",
  "llm_configured": true,
  "llm_model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "ssl_certificates": true,
  "donutsentry_domain": "q.chat.hypernym.ai"
}
```

**Rationale**: Operational visibility and monitoring

### 4. Updated README.md
**File**: `README.md`
**Changes**:
- Updated "High Port Configuration" section
- Documented HIGH_PORT_MODE environment variable
- Added health check endpoint example
- Removed outdated instructions about editing source code

**Rationale**: Documentation matches new functionality

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Development Mode Test**:
   ```bash
   HIGH_PORT_MODE=true ./chat
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

2. **Production Mode Test**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./chat
   curl http://localhost/health
   ```

3. **SSL Certificate Detection Test**:
   - Test with cert.pem/key.pem in working directory
   - Test with Let's Encrypt certificates
   - Test with missing certificates (should disable HTTPS)

## Deployment Notes

- These changes are backward compatible
- No database migrations required
- No configuration file changes required
- Existing deployments will continue to work unchanged

## Future Improvements Considered

1. Add metrics endpoint for Prometheus
2. Add readiness vs liveness probe separation
3. Add graceful shutdown handling
4. Add config file support (currently all env vars)
5. Add automatic Let's Encrypt certificate generation

## Summary

These modifications make ch.at more suitable for production deployment while maintaining its core philosophy of simplicity. The changes focus on operational improvements without adding unnecessary complexity or dependencies.
