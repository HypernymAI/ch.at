# DoNutSentry Development - 2025-08-16

## Overview

Today we implemented DoNutSentry v1, a DNS-based query protocol that enables ch.at to work through any DNS resolver. This solves the critical limitation where ch.at currently requires direct DNS queries, which fail behind corporate firewalls and restricted networks.

## What We Built Today

### 1. DoNutSentry v1 Specification
- Designed recursive DNS resolver support using wildcard subdomains (`*.q.ch.at`)
- Created three query modes:
  - **Simple mode**: For basic alphanumeric queries < 50 chars (`what-is-dns.q.ch.at`)
  - **Base32 mode**: For queries with special characters/Unicode
  - **Session mode**: For queries exceeding DNS limits (automatic chunking)

### 2. JavaScript/TypeScript Client
- Full client implementation in `mega_feature_development/DoNutSentry/client-js/`
- Features:
  - Automatic encoding strategy selection
  - Transparent session mode for large queries
  - RSA key exchange for anonymous sessions
  - Comprehensive test suite (all tests passing)
- Dependencies:
  - `hi-base32`: RFC 4648 compliant base32 encoding
  - `lzjs`: Initially for compression (later removed)
  - Standard Node.js crypto for RSA operations

### 3. Session Protocol Design
- Anonymous session establishment via RSA-2048
- Chunked transmission format: `<session_id>.<chunk_num>.<data>.q.ch.at`
- Flow:
  1. Client sends public key hash: `<pubkey_hash>.init.q.ch.at`
  2. Server returns RSA-encrypted session ID
  3. Client sends chunks with sequence numbers
  4. Client sends exec command: `<session_id>.<total_chunks>.exec.q.ch.at`
  5. Server assembles and processes, returns full response

### 4. Key Technical Decisions

#### Removed Compression
- Initially implemented LZSS compression
- Found that base32 encoding overhead (1.6x expansion) negated compression benefits
- Example: 102 bytes → 88 compressed → 165 base32 encoded (worse than 164 direct)
- Decision: Remove compression, use session mode for large queries

#### Base32 Encoding Choice
- DNS labels only allow `[a-z0-9-]`
- Base32 provides standard encoding with 1.6x expansion
- Used hi-base32 library for RFC 4648 compliance

#### Session Security
- 32-byte session IDs provide sufficient entropy
- RSA encryption during exchange prevents hijacking
- No authentication required (maintains anonymity)

## Current Status

### What Works
- ✅ Client fully implemented and tested
- ✅ Encoding strategies (simple, base32)
- ✅ Session mode with chunking
- ✅ All tests passing with real crypto

### What Needs Implementation (Server Side)
- ❌ Wildcard DNS handler in `dns.go`
- ❌ Session storage (in-memory with TTL)
- ❌ RSA key exchange handling
- ❌ Chunk assembly and execution
- ❌ Backward compatibility with direct queries

## Testing Results

Attempted to test against localhost but encountered issues:
- ch.at DNS handler only responds to queries ending in `.ch.at`
- Need to modify `dns.go` to handle wildcard subdomains
- Client correctly generates:
  - `what-is-dns.q.ch.at` (simple encoding)
  - `k5ugc5banfzsaqkjh4.q.ch.at` (base32 encoding)
- Direct DNS to production ch.at works: `dig @ch.at "what is dns" TXT`

## Next Steps

### 1. Server Implementation (Priority)
Modify `dns.go` to handle DoNutSentry queries:
```go
func handleDNS(w dns.ResponseWriter, r *dns.Msg) {
    // Add check for *.q.ch.at queries
    if strings.HasSuffix(q.Name, ".q.ch.at.") {
        handleDoNutSentryQuery(w, r, q)
        return
    }
    // ... existing direct query handling
}
```

### 2. Session Management
- Implement in-memory session storage with expiration
- Add session init/chunk/exec handlers
- Handle RSA encryption/decryption

### 3. Integration Testing
- Test client against local server implementation
- Verify session mode with large queries
- Test rate limiting and security

### 4. Documentation
- Update ch.at README with DoNutSentry usage
- Add examples for different query types
- Document server configuration

### 5. Future Enhancements (v2+)
- Sweep space protocol for semantic navigation
- Multi-resolution embeddings
- Agent-to-agent communication
- Distributed session state

### Modified Files
- `chat.go` - Changed ports for local testing (HTTP: 8080, DNS: 5353)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Compression isn't always helpful** - Base32 encoding overhead can negate compression benefits
2. **Session mode is more flexible** - Better than trying to squeeze everything into one query
3. **Real crypto in tests** - Don't mock crypto functions, use the real implementations
4. **DNS limitations are strict** - 63 chars per label, 255 total, must plan carefully

## Summary

DoNutSentry v1 client is complete and ready. The protocol design is solid, using standard DNS with smart encoding strategies and session-based chunking for large queries. Next step is server implementation to make ch.at truly accessible from any network.
