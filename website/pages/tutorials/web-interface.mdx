## Advanced Features

### Path-Based Queries

Instead of using the form, you can encode queries in the URL:

```
https://ch.at/what-is-machine-learning
https://ch.at/explain-docker-containers
https://ch.at/python-vs-javascript
```

Hyphens in the URL are converted to spaces.

### Conversation Context

The interface maintains your conversation history:
- Previous Q&A pairs are visible on the page
- Context is sent with each new query
- History is limited to 64KB to ensure compatibility
- History is stored client-side only (privacy by design)

### Formatting

Responses support HTML formatting:
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- `Code blocks` and inline code
- Hyperlinks

<Callout type="info">
  The web interface specifically requests HTML formatting instead of Markdown for better browser compatibility.
</Callout>

## Tips and Tricks

## Privacy Notes

- No cookies are used

If responses seem truncated, the 64KB history limit may be reached. Start a new chat.

### Formatting Issues
If formatting appears broken, your browser may not support certain HTML tags. Try a modern browser.

### Connection Issues
If responses don't appear, check your internet connection and try refreshing.
