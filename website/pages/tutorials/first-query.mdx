# Your First Query

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

Now that you've accessed ch.at, let's make your first query and understand how responses work.

## Making a Query


    ### Via Web Interface
    
    1. Go to [https://ch.at](https://ch.at)
    2. Type: "What is artificial intelligence?"
    3. Press Enter or click Send
    
    You'll see:
    - Your question appears in a gray box
    - The response streams in real-time below
    - History is preserved for the session

    ### Via Terminal
    
    ```bash
    curl -N ch.at/?q="What is artificial intelligence?"
    ```
    
    Or using the path format:
    ```bash
    curl ch.at/what-is-artificial-intelligence
    ```
    
    <Callout>
      The `-N` flag disables buffering for smoother streaming.
    </Callout>

    ### Via API
    
    ```bash
    curl ch.at/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "messages": [{
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is artificial intelligence?"
        }]
      }'
    ```
  

## Understanding Responses

### Response Format

Responses are:
- **Streamed**: Characters appear as they're generated
- **Markdown-formatted**: Links, code blocks, lists are supported
- **Context-aware**: Follow-up questions remember previous context

### Response Limits

Different protocols have different limits:

| Protocol | Response Limit | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| HTTP/API | Unlimited* | Streams until complete |
| SSH | Unlimited* | Real-time streaming |
| DNS | ~500 chars | Automatically concise |

<Callout type="info">
  *Limited by the AI model's token limits, typically 4,096 tokens
</Callout>

## Common First Queries

Try these to get started:

```bash
# General knowledge
curl ch.at/explain-quantum-computing-simply

# Programming help
curl ch.at/python-vs-javascript-comparison

# Creative tasks
curl ch.at/write-a-haiku-about-coding

# Technical questions
curl ch.at/how-does-https-work
```

## Tips for Better Responses

1. **Be specific**: "Explain REST APIs" â†’ "Explain REST APIs with examples"
2. **Set context**: "In Python, how do I..." vs just "How do I..."
3. **Request format**: "List 5 benefits of..." for structured responses
4. **Follow up**: The web interface maintains context for conversations
