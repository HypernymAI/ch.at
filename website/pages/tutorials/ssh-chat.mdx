# SSH Chat Sessions

import { Callout, Steps } from 'nextra/components'

Connect to ch.at via SSH for an interactive terminal-based chat experience. No authentication required!

## Quick Start

```bash
ssh ch.at
```

<Callout type="info">
  First time connecting? You'll see a host key verification prompt. Type `yes` to continue.
</Callout>

## Features

- **Anonymous Access**: No username or password needed
- **Real-time Streaming**: Responses appear as they're generated
- **Line Editing**: Use backspace to edit your input
- **Clean Interface**: Minimal, distraction-free chat
- **Multiple Sessions**: Connect from multiple terminals

## Basic Usage

<Steps>

### Connect via SSH

```bash
ssh ch.at
```

### Read the Welcome Message

```
Welcome to ch.at
Type your message and press Enter.
Exit: type 'exit', Ctrl+C, or Ctrl+D
> 
```

### Type Your Question

Type your question at the prompt and press Enter

### Read the Response

The response will stream in real-time

### Continue or Exit

- Type another question to continue
- Type `exit` to disconnect
- Press `Ctrl+C` or `Ctrl+D` to exit

</Steps>

## Connection Options

### Custom Port

If ch.at runs on a non-standard port:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 ch.at
```

### Verbose Mode

Debug connection issues:

```bash
ssh -v ch.at
```

### Keep Alive

Prevent timeout on long responses:

```bash
ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 ch.at
```

## Advanced Features

### Input Editing

- **Backspace**: Delete last character
- **Ctrl+U**: Clear current line (on most terminals)
- **Ctrl+C**: Cancel current input and start fresh

### Session Management

Each SSH connection is independent:
- No shared history between sessions
- Multiple concurrent sessions supported
- Rate limiting per IP address

### SSH Config

Add to `~/.ssh/config` for convenience:

```
Host chat
    HostName ch.at
    Port 22
    ServerAliveInterval 60
```

Then connect with:
```bash
ssh chat
```

## Integration Examples

### Logging Sessions

Save your chat session:

```bash
ssh ch.at | tee chat-session-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
```

### Scripted Input

Send predefined questions:

```bash
echo "What is SSH?" | ssh ch.at
```

Or multiple questions:

```bash
cat questions.txt | ssh ch.at
```

### Expect Script

Automate interactions:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/expect
spawn ssh ch.at
expect "> "
send "What is expect?\r"
expect "> "
send "exit\r"
expect eof
```

## Security Notes

<Callout type="warning">
  SSH connections are encrypted, but the ch.at server sees your queries in plain text.
</Callout>

### Host Key Changes

If you see a host key warning:

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
```

This means the server's key has changed. For ch.at, this is expected as the host key is ephemeral.

To connect anyway:
```bash
ssh-keygen -R ch.at
ssh ch.at
```

### Connection Security

- All traffic is encrypted via SSH
- No authentication required (anonymous access)
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- No session logs kept on server

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Refused

```bash
ssh: connect to host ch.at port 22: Connection refused
```

**Solutions**:
- Check if you're behind a firewall blocking port 22
- Try connecting to a different port if configured
- Verify the server is running

### Connection Timeout

```bash
ssh: connect to host ch.at port 22: Operation timed out
```

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Try using a VPN if SSH is blocked
- Use verbose mode to debug: `ssh -v ch.at`

### Broken Pipe

```
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe
```

**Solutions**:
- Add `ServerAliveInterval` to keep connection alive
- Check for network interruptions
- Reconnect and continue

## Use Cases

1. **Quick Queries**: Fast access without opening a browser
2. **Remote Access**: Use from servers without GUI
3. **Automation**: Script interactions with expect
4. **Privacy**: Encrypted connection for sensitive queries
5. **Simplicity**: No software installation required

## Limitations

- No persistent history between sessions
- Text-only responses (no images or rich formatting)
- Single-line input (no multi-line queries)
- Connection may timeout on very long responses
